Not an interesting decision:
choice a, b and c
if player always goes a, then the computer should just do it for them


Games should be fun -> intersting decisions make game fun

Can be good when debugging ("Where's the fun?")


Characteristics of intersrting decisions:
- trade-offs (Car with great handling, but less fast, or other car with bad handling but very fast)
- situational (interacts with the game situation, immersion in the game? One result of a decision is good ina certain situation)
- personal (expressing of self, turtle strat vs rushdown)
- Persistence (Effect for a certain amount of time -> make the player know that it's a long term decision) 

"I need more decisions, the player has too little agency"

Types of decisions:
- Risk vs reward (go fast and risky, or play slow and save)
- short term vs long term (some cute instant vs smth long term)
- playstyle and personality (turtle vs rush? example: 7 difficulties in civ)
- multiple goals -> several strategies working at the same time?
- customization (player representation)


IMPORTANT: HOW we present the decison
~~~Setting the Scene

- What information does the player have befroe making the decision?
- What is the learning curve?
  -> this will change how decisions will be made later on
- Use Genre conventions -> piggy backing (red barrels go bumm)
- Histrociatl coinnection? Sci-f? Zombies? Setting?


bis 25:00 Minuten

Feedback of the decision is good
-> Either comfort player or tell them what would've happend if chosen different

"Does anyone know I'm here?"

Decision Feedback Loop
-> get a core loop and repeat it
-> the more you go around the core loop the better?


Player Feedback types:
- Mr. Kick-Butt: Only cares about winning, if win game = fun, if not game fucking sucks
- Ms. Genre: Loves the genre, if the game isn't 100% like the fav genre complains. "In game x they do somethinmg, copy that"
- Mr. MinMax: Really needs to understand everything -> tries to reverse engnenerer the game
- Ms. Paranoid: The Computer is cheating!! RNG is rigged
- Mr. Histroy: If something isn't 100% histroci accurate complains
- Mr. Bubble-boy: Remembers the 1 bad thing that happend and gets stuck there
- Mr. Designer: They wish you made a different game "why is your game not the other game I want to play"

Making Decisions More Interesting

- Balance decisions
- More important -> tie more into what the game is about
- More/less information the player have
  -> ex. fog of war makes early decisions easier
- More/Fewer choices
  -> often combingning  choices makes them interesting+
  -> often remove redundant choices
- more flavorful (sound, vfx, etc.)
- more/less time, how much time has a player
  -> "Most genre are designed by the amoung of time the player has for a decision"
  -> ex. slower shooter is a stealth game, faster shooter is action fps
  -> simple decisions + much downtime = boring
  -> difficult decision + little downtime = overwhelming


"combination of gameworld and decisions is important"
