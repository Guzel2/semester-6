Not an interesting decision:
choice a, b and c
if player always goes a, then the computer should just do it for them


Games should be fun -> intersting decisions make game fun

Can be good when debugging ("Where's the fun?")


Characteristics of intersrting decisions:
- trade-offs (Car with great handling, but less fast, or other car with bad handling but very fast)
- situational (interacts with the game situation, immersion in the game? One result of a decision is good ina certain situation)
- personal (expressing of self, turtle strat vs rushdown)
- Persistence (Effect for a certain amount of time -> make the player know that it's a long term decision) 

"I need more decisions, the player has too little agency"

Types of decisions:
- Risk vs reward (go fast and risky, or play slow and save)
- short term vs long term (some cute instant vs smth long term)
- playstyle and personality (turtle vs rush? example: 7 difficulties in civ)
- multiple goals -> several strategies working at the same time?
- customization (player representation)


IMPORTANT: HOW we present the decison
~~Setting the Scene

- What information does the player have befroe making the decision?
- What is the learning curve?
  -> this will change how decisions will be made later on
- Use Genre conventions -> piggy backing (red barrels go bumm)
- Histrociatl coinnection? Sci-f? Zombies? Setting?
